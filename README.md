## ðŸŒ¸ Part 1: About the Iris Dataset

The Iris dataset, introduced by British statistician Ronald A. Fisher in a 1936 research publication, stands as one of the most extensively utilised datasets within the domains of data science and machine learning.

This research titled *"The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems"* contains 150 samples (50 each) of iris flowers collected from there species:
- *Iris setosa*
- *Iris versicolor*
- *Iris vulgarica* 

Attribute information dataset is:
- Sepal length (cm)
- Sepal width (cm)
- Petal length (cm)
- Petal width (cm)
- Class

The primary objective of examining this dataset frequently involves determining the species of a flower utilising the provided measurements. Due to its limited size, clarity, and ease of measurement, this dataset has gained popularity as an introductory resource for acquiring skills in data analysis, data visualization, and classification techniques within the Python programming environment.\
It is commonly used in tutorials for learning Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn. Itâ€™s also an excellent dataset to practice working with lists, loops, conditionals, and basic statistics.
